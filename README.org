* mic: Minimal configuration manager for Emacs
#+BEGIN_QUOTE
=mic= is uncustomizable. Define your own =mic=.
#+END_QUOTE

=mic= is minimal configuration manager for Emacs.
This package is yet another =use-package= and =leaf=, but is also used with them (See [[Alternative]]).
=mic= is minimal, so if you would like to write complex configuration,
=mic= is a little redundant. However, there is no problem. =mic= is thought to be
used to core to define your own, another, more convenient =mic=.
There are some functions to define your own =mic=.

* How to Use?
* Use =mic-core=, minimum one
* Use default =mic=
* Alternative
* License
  This package is licensed by GPLv3. See [[file:LICENSE][LICENSE]].
